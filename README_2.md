# Exercises Part 2


# Preliminaries
Make sure you set the seed of 0421 before splitting the data set into training data and test data.
Use 60% for the training data set before you proceed, so results are comparable.

If you struggle, review the R-Code from session 7 and 9.

# Hypothesis testing
Use the training data for this analysis.

Based on the exploratory analysis in part 1: 

1. Pick 2 variables that you expect to have an important influence on housing prices in Delhi. 

2. Formulate 2 hypotheses about how these variables influence the housing prices. 

3. If necessary, conduct appropriate pre-processing steps (explain which those are and why you use them). 

4. Test the hypotheses in an OLS model with one predictor respectively. Interpret the models (coefficients, standard errors, significance, goodness of fit). 

5. Pick 2 to 3 important control variables to add to each of the models. Give a reason why you choose those controls. 

6. Add the controls to the models, and then interpret the models (coefficients, standard errors, significance, goodness of fit). 

7. Think about whether there may be interaction effects between the variables. Add and interpret them if applicable.

#Prediction
Now, build a model to predict the housing prices.

Think about useful or necessary pre-processing steps (like Principal Component Analysis or log-transformation for example). Explain why you do / do not choose to pre-process the data.

Now, use the training data to train 3 to 6 models that you expect to do a good job at prediction. Use RMSEA as the loss function.

Then, test those models on the training data.

Provide an overview of the results and explain which model is the best.
